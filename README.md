# Phase 2: Full-Stack Todo Application

This project is a full-stack web application for managing tasks. It features a Next.js frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a Neon PostgreSQL database.

## Architecture

The project is structured as a monorepo with the following components:

- **Frontend:** A Next.js application located in the `/frontend` directory. It provides a modern and responsive user interface for interacting with the application.
- **Backend:** A FastAPI application located in the `/backend` directory. It serves a RESTful API for managing tasks and users.
- **Database:** A Neon PostgreSQL database is used for data persistence. SQLModel is used as the ORM for interacting with the database.

## Local Setup

### Backend (FastAPI)

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies using uv:**
    ```bash
    uv venv
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up the environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following variables:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL="your_neon_database_url"
    BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your_secret_key"
    ```

4.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn api.main:app --reload
    ```

### Frontend (Next.js)

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies using npm:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Environment Variables for Vercel

The following environment variables need to be set in your Vercel project:

- `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string for your Neon PostgreSQL database.
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: A secret key for JWT authentication.

## API Endpoints

The following REST endpoints are available in the backend API. All endpoints are protected with JWT authentication.

| Method | Endpoint                  | Description                   | Security      |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|
| POST   | `/api/tasks/`             | Create a new task             | JWT Protected |
| GET    | `/api/tasks/`             | Get all tasks for the user    | JWT Protected |
| GET    | `/api/tasks/{task_id}`    | Get a specific task by ID     | JWT Protected |
| PUT    | `/api/tasks/{task_id}`    | Update a task                 | JWT Protected |
| DELETE | `/api/tasks/{task_id}`    | Delete a task                 | JWT Protected |
| PUT    | `/api/tasks/{task_id}/toggle` | Toggle a task's completion | JWT Protected |
